Equipment needed: Hum Eliminator, XLR cabling, 2x 1/8" to 1/4" adapters.
1. If the sound board contains a label along the bottom already, use it as closely as possible. Sound operators are welcome to create their own labels if they wish, using a piece of white gaffer's tape (get from scoring table).
2. Use the diagram below to guide the plug-in and configuration of the sound board.

	%%TODO: Get a photo of hum eliminator input.%%
4. Attach the output of the Hum Eliminator to the Streaming Unit. Follow the instructions below to determine how to connect to the computer.
	1. North route's XLR inputs are not working correctly. As a workaround, connect a 1/4" to 1/8" cable (available in the Streaming Unit drawers or the Audio A/V tote) to the Line Input jack of the computer in the Streaming Unit.
		%%TODO: Get photo of 1/4" to 1/8" cable and the line in jack of the computer.%%
	2. %%South route should connect an XLR cable from the output of the Hum Eliminator to the ATEM Audio Aux 1 XLR input on the Streaming Unit.%%
