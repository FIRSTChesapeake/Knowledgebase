Open the Syncthing interface and sync media. The method to do this currently varies depending on which streaming unit is being run. 
	1. If an icon like this ![](syncthing-icon-2048x2048-mvwfe1p7.png)is present in the taskbar, click it and then click "Sync".
	2. If the icon is not present, open the web browser and navigate to [http://locahost:8384](http://locahost:8384/) (this link will only work on a machine that has Syncthing running).
%%  TODO: Get a screenshot of the buttons for both of these. %%
