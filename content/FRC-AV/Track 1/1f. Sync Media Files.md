Open the Syncthing interface and sync media. The method to do this currently varies depending on which streaming unit is being run. 
1. If an icon like this ![](syncthing-icon-2048x2048-mvwfe1p7.png)is present in the taskbar, click it to open the interface.
2. If the icon is not present, open the web browser and navigate to [http://locahost:8384](http://locahost:8384/) (this link will only work on a machine that has Syncthing running).
3. Click the "Rescan All" button at the bottom of the left side list.

> [!warning] Ensure Sync Has Actually Occurred
> If Syncthing cannot contact any other peers in its network, it will falsely report that the folder is up to date. The sync process should take a minimum of a few seconds of processing and at least one machine listed in the right-side panel (under "Remote Devices") needs to be listed as "Connected". If neither of these are true, the traffic may be getting blocked by the school network. Contact the Equipment Manager in this case.

%%  TODO: Get a screenshot of the buttons for both of these. %%
