Supplies needed: 16' tripod, ball head joint.
1. Locate the Center Camera in the [Storage Case](FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions). It should be located in the drawer marked "Cameras".

 4. Mount the ball head joint to the screw thread on the tall tripod, and the camera to the ball head joint. Tighten until camera is secure and pointed relatively at the field. Don't raise the camera just yet.

> [!Info] Don't lose the lens cap!
>  Be sure to place the lens cap back in the Camera drawer of the Storage Case so it does not get lost.

 6. Extend the legs on the tripod so that they lay stably on the floor (i.e., the center joint is off of the ground). A sandbag (found in the [AV case](FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions)) can be used to attach to the center joint and stabilize further, if needed.
Stage 2a is complete.
