Materials needed: Standalone SDI cable, mini-SDI to SDI cable, center camera power adapter, extension cord, outlet tri-tap, ball mount
1. Retrieve the center camera power adapter and mini-SDI to SDI cable (shown below) from the Overview Camera tote.

2. Retrieve an extension cord and a tri-tap from the power [AV tote](FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions). The tri-tap may be located in one of the Streaming Unit drawers instead of the power tote.
> [!NOTE] Keeping Up Appearances
> The center camera is the most visible to the audience of all of the cameras. Keep tidiness and neatness in mind while setting this camera up. For example, avoid using an orange or yellow extension cord in the cabling of this camera.

3. Retrieve two standard SDI cables from the SDI [AV tote](FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions). These cable should not be in a sleeved bundle and should contain only the twist-lock BNC connector on the ends. Ideally, one should be short (~10 feet) and one should be long (sufficient distance to reach to the streaming unit). 
	%%TODO: Get a photo of a standard SDI cable, with an additional one focusing on the ends. If there is one of sufficiently short length, get a photo of both together.%%
	Note that if one SDI cable is of insufficient length to make the run, there are BNC couplers inside the drawers of the [Streaming Unit](FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions) or the SDI AV tote. You may need to investigate the ends of the SDI cables inside the tote to find one that is still connected to a cable, or pull all of them out to investigate the bottom of the tote. **If a BNC coupler is used, it should be placed back in the topmost drawer of the Streaming Unit when finished.**
	%%TODO: Get a photo of a BNC coupler and show its position in the drawer.%%
4. Attach the mini-SDI to SDI cable to the "SDI Out" port of the camera. Plug the camera power adapter into the DC In jack of the camera. Twist the silver ring clockwise until just snug to secure the connector.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of both cables in the respective ports.%%
5. Retrieve a clamping ball mount. This is most likely to be in one of the Streaming Unit drawers.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of a clamping ball mount. Also note that we may not have sufficient clamps to make this happen. Get a count and if we only have 2, abandon the video monitor thread.%%
6. Retrieve the SDI monitor from the topmost Streaming Unit drawer.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the monitor inside the drawer (placed towards the top for easy recognition).%%
7. Attach the SDI monitor to an accessible position on the tripod. Attach the (shorter) SDI cable coming from the camera to the SDI In port on the back of the monitor and the (longer) SDI cable to the SDI Out port.
8. Run the extension cord (with tri-tap on the output) from an accessible location with power to the area where the center camera is to be located. This is most commonly going to be from the scoring table, but some venues have power that is closer from the rear. Use the path that will cross the least amount of walkways and consult with the Equipment Manager if you have any questions.
9. Run the long SDI cable back to the Streaming Unit and attach the SDI connector to the Cam Center input. Note that the power output for this camera will be unused.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the SDI plugged in without a power connector.%%
10. Plug in the power for the SDI monitor and the camera. Verify that the camera powers up (look for an LED on the top of the camera to light up in red) and that the monitor shows a video signal. Verify that the signal is reflected on the Streaming Unit's input for the center camera feed. Check all SDI cabling if any failure in video signal is detected at this time. If a cable is flaky (i.e., cuts out when any torque is put on it or is otherwise intermittent), replace it and notify the Equipment Manager of the cable.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the camera's power light on and the video monitor showing signal.%%
