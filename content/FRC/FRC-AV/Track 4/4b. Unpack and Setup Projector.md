Supplies Needed: Field perimeter case, Long SDI cable (potentially more than one, depending on distance), SDI coupler (if more than one SDI cable is required), SDI to HDMI converter, projector, tablet, extension cord, power strip, one or more lengths of pipe and drape (depends on venue, see step 9).
1. Retrieve the projector and SDI to HDMI converter (inside the box) from the [[FRC/FRC-AV/index#Equipment Locations and Storage Descriptions|AV case]]. 
	%%TODO: Get a photo of projector box closed and open (showing SDI to HDMI converter).%%
2. Retrieve the tablet from the [[FRC/FRC-AV/index#Equipment Locations and Storage Descriptions|Storage Case]].
3. Retrieve an extension cord and power strip (or an extension cord with multiple outlets) from the power [[FRC/FRC-AV/index#Equipment Locations and Storage Descriptions|AV tote]].
4. Retrieve an empty field perimeter case (shown below), and place the projector and converter on top of the perimeter case. 
	%%TODO: Get photo of a field perimeter case.%%
5. Roll the case between the legs of the projector screen. 
	%%TODO: Get photo of case between projector legs.%%
6. Connect the projector to power using the power strip or the extension cord with multiple outlets.
7. Turn on the projector using the power button on the remote or on the back of the projector. 
8. Use the Epson Setting Assistant app on the tablet to calibrate the projected image to fit the screen.

>3. While the projector generates a QR code, open the "Epson Setting Assistant" application on the tablet.
>4. Once the projector displays the QR code, press the "Connect using a QR code" button on the app.
>%%TODO: Get a screenshot of the "Connect using a QR code" button/welcome screen.%%
>5. Scan the QR code and press "Join" when prompted to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
>6. The app allows for setup either projected onto a wall or onto a screen. Since we are using a screen, select this option to proceed with setup.
>%%TODO: Get a screenshot of the wall/screen selection image, circling the screen option.%%
>7. Analyze the screen shape and compare it with that presented in the app. If the image is very crooked or keystoned, make manual adjustments to improve the baseline image's shape.
>8. Confirm and press the "Display pattern" button. **Before taking a pattern of the screen**, pull the projector back so that the projected pattern slightly overhangs all four edges of the screen. Uneven overhang is acceptable and will be corrected.
>9. Take a picture of the pattern, ensuring that the full pattern and screen is captured.
>10. Once the adjustments are finished, press the "Close app" button. On the projector, press the "Finish" button when it presents you with a similar setup prompt as in step 6.
>%%TODO: Get a screenshot of the finished screen of the app.%%
