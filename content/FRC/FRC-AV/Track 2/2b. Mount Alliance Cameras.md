Supplies needed: 2x Combination SDI/Power cable, 2x camera (Red & Blue), 2x tripod, 2x camera power cable, gaff tape.

1. Retrieve two tripods from the [[FRC/FRC-AV/index#Equipment Locations and Storage Descriptions|AV Case]]. Because of their small size, the tripods may also be located in one of the [[FRC/FRC-AV/index#Equipment Locations and Storage Descriptions|AV totes]]. 
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the small tripods in bags.%%
2. Retrieve two combination SDI/Power cables. These cables have braided sleeves on the outside.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the combination power/SDI cables.%%
3. Retrieve two camera power cables. There are two types of camera power cables in use, as pictured below. 
	%%TODO: Get a photo of each type of camera power cable.%%
4. Determine where the alliance cameras are going to be placed. The specifications vary from year to year, so check with the Equipment Manager on where the cameras should go.
5. Run one cable to each location, placing cables out of walkways or using cable ramps where crossing a walkway is required.

> [!NOTE] Camera Power Cable Polarity+
> The camera power cables will only go one way. The side of the cable with the plastic protruding from the metal housing goes "out", i.e., towards the camera. The side of the cable with metal pins recessed inside the metal housing goes "in", i.e., towards the streaming unit.  
> %%TODO: Get a photo of both sides of the cable and annotate them with the gist of the above text.%%

6. Place the cameras on the tripods and raise them if necessary. 
7. Connect the camera power cable to the power cable (XLR side).
	%%TODO: Get a photo showing the power connection.%%
8. Connect the SDI cable to the SDI output on the camera.
	%%TODO: Get a photo showing the SDI connection.%%
