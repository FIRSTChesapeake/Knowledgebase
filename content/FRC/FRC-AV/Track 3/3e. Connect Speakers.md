Supplies needed: XLR cables (quantity/length varies depending on setup), speakers (if required)
1. Determine what the event is going to use for sound. In preference order the options are:
	A. House sound (speakers mounted in the venue)
	B.  House sound with Chesapeake speaker (if needed for supplemental sound coverage)
	C. Chesapeake speakers.
2. Hook up the main sound output to the "XLR Main Out" XLR jack on the back of the Streaming Unit. 
	In options A or B above, this corresponds to the house sound input. This typically requires a very long XLR cable. In option C above, this corresponds to one of the two Chesapeake speakers (it does not matter which).
3. If the Chesapeake speakers are in use, hook one or both up to the "XLR Fill Out" XLR jack on the back of the Streaming Unit.
	In option C above, hook the other Chesapeake speaker to this output. In option B above, hook one Chesapeake speaker to this output, then hook the second speaker to the "Thru" port on the first speaker.
	%%TODO: Get a series of photos of daisy-chaining speaker audio connections.%%
4. Utilize the specialized XLR outputs as requested by event volunteers/at the Equipment Manager's discretion. The "Announcer Out" outputs only game sounds and commentator microphones. The "Game Sound Out" outputs only game sounds.
