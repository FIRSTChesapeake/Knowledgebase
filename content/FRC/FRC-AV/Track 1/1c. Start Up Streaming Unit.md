1. Locate the uninterruptible power supply at the bottom of the Streaming Unit.
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the UPS in the rack, with a circle around the power button.%%
2. If the screen is off, press and release the power button (marked in red, above) to wake the screen up. With the screen on, press and hold hold the power button for five seconds and then release it. The UPS should beep and turn the power on.
3. Verify that the UPS does not emit a repeating series of four beeps followed by a pause for several seconds. This beep pattern indicates that AC power has been lost and the unit is on battery. If this is the case, or if it occurs during the event, work with the Equipment Manager or other event personnel to determine why power is not being delivered to the Streaming Unit. 

> [!Note] UPS Runtime
>The UPS has a timer that counts down on the screen when it is in battery mode, but it can typically support 20-30 minutes of operation. Thus, while loss of power is not immediately harmful, it should be prioritized and fixed as soon as time allows (e.g., after the current match concludes).

4. Press the power button on the streaming unit PC to turn it on. Verify that lights are lit on all of the equipment in the rack case, as well as on the computer. 
	%%TODO: Get a photo of the front of the PC lit powered on.%%
