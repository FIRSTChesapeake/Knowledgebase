1. Login to the Streaming Unit using the credentials provided separately.
2. Determine if Streaming Unit has Internet connectivity. The Windows networking icon is often inaccurate and/or slow to update. A better test is to launch the YouTube website or another site (e.g., https://www.firstinspires.org/, https://www.firstchesapeake.org/).
3. Follow these steps only if connectivity fails. Otherwise, stage 1d is complete. Continue to [stage 1f](1f.%20Sync%20Media%20Files.md).
	1. Verify connectivity with the Streaming Unit rack router: `ping <router IP address>`
		This address is variable depending on which route you are working with. Refer to the label on the front of the Streaming Unit to determine which IP address to ping.
		%%TODO: Get photo of IP label (redacted?)%% 
	   If this fails, release and renew the IP address on the streaming unit computer.
	   (from an administrative command prompt, run):
	   `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew`
	   If continued failure, reboot Streaming Unit computer.
	   If still continued failure, seek assistance from Equipment Manager to carry out steps in [stage 1e](1e.%20Troubleshoot%20Connectivity%20Issues.md).
