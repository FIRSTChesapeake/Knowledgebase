1. Login to the Streaming Unit using the credentials provided separately.
2. Determine if Streaming Unit has Internet connectivity. The Windows networking icon is often inaccurate and/or slow to update. A better test is to launch the YouTube website or another site (e.g., https://www.firstinspires.org/, https://www.firstchesapeake.org/).
3. Follow these steps only if connectivity fails. Otherwise, stage 1d is complete. Continue to [stage 1f](1f.%20Sync%20Media%20Files.md).
	1. Verify that the network equipment has booted all the way up. The network equipment takes a few minutes to boot. If either of the silver servers in the rack show a progress bar and timer, as seen below, wait until the progress bars disappear before trying any other steps.

	2. Look at the status display of the UDM Pro device, seen below. It will show basic status information for some common setup faults. Follow the prompts if any are shown on the screen.
		%%TODO: Get photo of "no cable" error screen on the UDM Pro. See if there is a corresponding error screen for not having an IP address or greater Internet connectivity.%%
	3. Verify connectivity with the Streaming Unit rack router: `ping <router IP address>`
		This address is variable depending on which route you are working with. Refer to the label on the front of the Streaming Unit to determine which IP address to ping.

	   If this fails, release and renew the IP address on the streaming unit computer.
	   (from an administrative command prompt, run):
	   `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew`
	   If continued failure, reboot Streaming Unit computer.
	   If still continued failure, seek assistance from Equipment Manager to carry out steps in [stage 1e](1e.%20Troubleshoot%20Connectivity%20Issues.md).
