> - Check the right-side column labeled "Remote Devices". At least one device in this list needs to have the word "Connected" or "Up to Date" listed next to it. The screenshot above shows a successful connection.
> 	- If no devices are listed as "Connected", start by verifying basic Internet connectivity (refer to [[1d. Test Connectivity]] or [[1e. Troubleshoot Connectivity Issues]] if necessary). If basic Internet connectivity is present, it is likely that the Syncthing traffic is being blocked by the school's firewalls. If possible, work with venue IT staff to unblock the traffic, otherwise it may be necessary to temporarily utilize a hotspot to successfully sync. Consult with the FTA or Equipment Manager if you believe Syncthing is being blocked.
