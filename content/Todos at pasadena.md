- [ ] Gather photos - many setup steps need photo documentation. Search for TODO in other pages.
- [ ] Test the limits of the center camera - find the closest possible distance for full-field image and its associated declination. Glen allen was 17.5 feet from the truss to center of tripod pole and was a fairly shallow angle. The 7.5mm lens needed approx. 15 feet at a 30 degree declination for full coverage.
- [ ] Determine what camera settings need to be tuned at events. Likely the lens aperture needs to be tuned to minimize image gain. Anything else? 
- [ ] Glen Allen complained of grainy center image - investigate. May be related to previous item.
- [ ] Spare SDI input is only connected to ATEM - the production input is connected to channel 4 on the multiview. Need to swap the SDI to the spare cam input
- [ ] Download scene collection from Syncthing

Questions about VAGLE:
- Did any settings change on the camera?
	- Default is 60 FPS, may want to change to 30 FPS
	- Default behavior is to output to HDMI only - need to change the setting to 1080p30 SDI output if power is lost. Also may want to connect to the streaming unit UPS.
- Did the monitor get mounted?
	- No
- How many ball mounts did you have?
	- One in the clear box
