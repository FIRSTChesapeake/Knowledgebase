- [ ] Gather photos - many setup steps need photo documentation. Search for TODO in other pages.
- [ ] Test the limits of the center camera - find the closest possible distance for full-field image and its associated declination. Glen allen was 17.5 feet from the truss to center of tripod pole and was a fairly shallow angle. The 7.5mm lens needed approx. 15 feet at a 30 degree declination for full coverage.
- [ ] Determine what camera settings need to be tuned at events. Likely the lens aperture needs to be tuned to minimize image gain. Anything else? 
- [ ] Glen Allen complained of grainy center image - investigate. May be related to previous item.
