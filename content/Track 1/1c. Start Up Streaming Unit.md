S1. Locate the uninterruptible power supply at the bottom of the Streaming Unit.![[IMG_20250222_155734)_marked.jpg]]
1. Press and hold the button on the left (marked in red, above) until the UPS lights up blue and beeps. Let go of the button and verify that the power stays on.
2. Verify that the UPS does not emit a repeating series of four beeps followed by a pause for several seconds. This beep pattern indicates that AC power has been lost and the unit is on battery. If this is the case, or if it occurs during the event, work with the FTA or other event personnel to determine why power is not being delivered to the Streaming Unit. 
> Tip:
> The UPS has a timer that counts down on the screen when it is in battery mode, but it can typically support 20-30 minutes of operation. Thus, while loss of power is not immediately harmful, it should be prioritized and fixed as soon as time allows (e.g., after the current match concludes).
4. Press the orange power button to start up streaming unit PC. Verify that lights are lit on the ATEM at the top of the rack case. 
	TODO: Get a photo of all lights lit up in case.
5. Verify that Chesapeake Router lights are on. If off, check the power switch on the back of router and verify it is flipped up.
	TODO: Get a photo of router power switch.
