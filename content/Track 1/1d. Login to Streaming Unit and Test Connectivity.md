1. Login to the Streaming Unit using the credentials provided separately.
2. Determine if Streaming Unit has Internet connectivity. The Windows networking icon is often inaccurate and/or slow to update. A better test is to launch the YouTube website or another site (e.g., firstinspires, FIRST chesapeake).
3. Follow these steps only if connectivity fails. Otherwise, continue to [stage 1f](1f.%20Sync%20Media%20Files.md).
	1. Verify connectivity with the Streaming Unit rack router: `ping 192.168.100.1`
	   If this fails, release and renew the IP address on the streaming unit computer.
	   (from an administrative command prompt, run):
	   `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew`
	   If continued failure, reboot Streaming Unit computer.
	   If still continued failure, seek assistance from Equipment Manager.
	2. Verify connectivity with the Chesapeake Router:  `ping 192.168.1.1`
	   If this fails, login to the Streaming Unit rack router.
	   %%TODO: Get screenshot of root router page.%%
	   Release and renew Streaming Unit rack router IP address.
	   %%TODO: Get screenshot of router 'status' page showing the release and renew buttons.%%
	3. Seek assistance from Equipment Manager to carry out steps in [stage 1e](1e.%20Configure%20Chesapeake%20Router.md).
