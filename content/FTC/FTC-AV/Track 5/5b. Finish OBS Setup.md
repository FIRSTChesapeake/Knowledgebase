Materials needed: None.
1. In OBS, navigate to the "Aud Display" or "Audience Display" scene in the bottom-left corner. ![[FTC/FTC-AV/Track 5/Media/image.png]]
2. Double-click on the FTC Score or Browser source. This may be named something different, but the icon (globe) should be identical to the one shown above. Paste the URL copied from stage 5a into the "URL" field. Verify that all settings are the same as shown in the screenshot below. Click OK once confirmed.  **Note: Adding the `!important` flag in the Custom CSS field where shown is very important to ensuring the transparent parts of the screen are correctly made transparent.**![[image 3.png]]
3. Click on the Center and both Field scenes and verify that all camera inputs are populated as expected. Check cable connections if any are not operating as expected. A disconnected cable is the most common source of no video. A faulty cable is also a potential culprit.
4. Ask the Scorekeeper to change video scenes to a scene with video from the scoring system and then a "video only" screen. You should see the cameras be overridden by the fullscreen scene and the cameras show again with the video only screen.
5. Ask the scorekeeper to play a match with sound. You should hear the match sound come through the speakers. If you don't, check to see if the fader for the Game Sound is turned up. If it is, check to see if FTCLive is outputting sound.

> 1. Ensure one of the Field scenes is on "Program", which will make sure you see the "FTC Score" source in the Audio Mixer. If the FTC Score source was missing or the wrong scene was loaded, try the sound effects again.
> 2. If that didn't work, click the three dots next to FTC Score's Audio Mixer entry and select "Advanced Audio Properties".

> 3. In the window that opens, verify that FTC Score has its "Audio Monitoring" setting set to "Monitor and Output". Close the window and try the sound effects again if this wasn't set.
