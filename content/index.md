title: FRC A/V Setup (Start Here)

# Equipment Locations and Storage Descriptions
All A/V equipment will be located in one of the following locations, and it all must go **back** into one of these locations at the conclusion of the event. It is important to keep the equipment organized. Generally, the equipment should be placed back in the locations where you found it. Here is a list of all of the locations where our A/V equipment can be found:
1.  *Streaming Unit case*
This is also known as the "Webstream Unit", "Streaming Unit", or other similar names. It is a large, tall black case on wheels labeled as the "streaming unit". It contains the main streaming equipment and cameras.

2. *Audio Case*
This is also known as the "mic box", "mic case", or similar. It is a small, square rackmount case that has a suitcase handle and wheels. It contains the equipment needed to run the wireless microphones.
%% TODO: Get photo of audio case closed and open. %%
3.  *A/V Totes*
These are a series of four green totes, labeled on each short side with gaff tape as "A/V", a route label (north or south) and a specific type label. There are four A/V totes: Audio, Power, SDI, and Ethernet. 
%% TODO: Get photo of tote stack, preferably also one with the totes open. %%
4. *A/V Case*
This is also known as "Case 26". It is a large, tan, wheeled case that contains miscellaneous equipment used for A/V, but the most relevant contents for this guide are the audio mixer, speakers, and projector. 
%% TODO: Get photo of Case 26 closed and open. %%
5. *Projection Screen case*
This is a short, long, black wheeled case that contains the large projection screen used at events.
%% TODO: Get photo of projector screen case. %%

# Stages and Order of Setup
The setup of the FIRST Chesapeake Audio/Visual equipment can be broken down into distinct tracks of tasks, each of which may be accomplished in parallel. However, within each distinct track certain tasks rely on others, so the order of tasks within them is important to follow. Also note that the following dependencies on other tracks:
- #### The FMS relies on the Chesapeake Router being cabled up and active. Expect intervention from the FTA if this is not very quickly setup.
- Most tracks rely on Track 1 being finished. At a minimum the back panel needs to be removed so the I/O panel is accessible.
- Track 2.2 relies on Track 2.1 being finished. You cannot run cable to a camera that isn't staged in position yet!
- Track 6 relies on field assembly being complete. This track may need to be left until the end of setup day, or possibly even the morning of the first day of competition.

## Track 0 (Gathering Materials)
Each of the five pieces of Equipment Storage described above should be moved to near where they will live during the event after they are removed from the Pods. Each event has a designated location for the screen and for A/V equipment, please consult with the Equipment Manager to determine where the setup is to be located. In the Equipment Manager's absence, the Event Manager can also provide guidance.
