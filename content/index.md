Welcome to the *FIRST* Chesapeake Knowledgebase! It is our goal to use this platform to provide a single place of reference for volunteer-centric documentation, specifically the under-documented aspects that are unique to *FIRST* Chesapeake events. As such, we split the knowledgebase between the two *FIRST* programs that *FIRST* Chesapeake hosts events for: [*FIRST* Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/ftc/) and [*FIRST* Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/).

Select the program whose knowledgebase you would like to see:
# [[FTC/index|FTC]]
# [[FRC/index|FRC]]
